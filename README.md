Its an app for manging home budget

You should be able to log in into yuor own account and setup some transactions and bank accounts
I am not planning on making it too difficult to develop so dont expect some advanced features like deposits or periodic payments

The tech stack will be Angular + Spring as it should get me a job fast :D

I am also using figma for mockups and maybe I will share some here

BTW it is just a simple remake of a project for uni but in the web

The goals for this app is to enable users to register log in and get password reset

after they log in they should be able to create accounts, transactions and categories
Also they should be able to filter transactions and manage accs trans and cats
The other feature is for users to be able to generate a Raport in pdf file
